/**
 * Everything the parking screen decides, as pure functions.
 *
 * The screen is a lot of conditional rendering, and conditional rendering is
 * the part of a UI that is cheapest to get wrong and most expensive to test
 * through the DOM. So the decisions live here — no React, no hooks, no
 * network — and the components below take the result and draw it. Each
 * function is transcribed from the design's own state machine
 * (`doc/design/lets-park-design.dc.html`, the `renderVals()` method), which is
 * the source of truth for this screen.
 *
 * Two rules the design does not state but the contract does, and which win
 * where they differ (see `doc/decision/0121-*`):
 *
 * 1. **`canReserve` is the backend's answer, never re-derived here.**
 *    `dayOverviewOutputSchema` says so in as many words: it already accounts
 *    for the window, the admin exemption, past dates and business days. The
 *    design's `ruleLocked = !windowOpen && !admin` is the same predicate for
 *    the two window cases and silently wrong for the other two.
 * 2. **`windowFrom`/`windowTo` are hypothetical unless `lockMode === 'AUTO'`.**
 *    A dated banner sentence under a forced mode would be a false statement.
