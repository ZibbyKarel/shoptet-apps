/**
 * The dialog behind a parking bay: reserve, queue, cancel, or an explanation.
 *
 * Presentational — every decision is on {@link SpotDialogProps}, and the four
 * actions are callbacks. The design draws this as four variants of one modal
 * (`08-modal-reserve.png`, `09-modal-queue.png`), keyed off `modalTitle`,
 * `modalSub`, `modalCta`, `modalCancel`, `modalPrimaryShow` and `modalLocked`;
 * so does this.
 *
 * **Two places where the design draws something the contract will not let it,
 * and the contract wins** (`plan.md`: contract-first; `doc/decision/0004-*`
 * gives the design the casting vote on *visuals*, not on what may cross the
 * wire):
 *
 * 1. **A name/SPZ form, but only for an admin.** The design's reserve modal has
 *    "Jméno" and "SPZ" inputs bound to `resName`/`resPlate`. For a normal user
 *    the contract still has nowhere to put them — the holder *is* the caller and
 *    the plate is read off their profile, which they edit in Nastavení — so
 *    their modal remains a confirmation. For an **admin**,
 *    `createReservationInputSchema.holder` now exists (TODO item 3,
 *    `doc/decision/0304-*`), so the two fields are real: a holder selector over
 *    the active users plus a guest option, and an overridable plate. The form is
 *    `libs/shared/form`; the holder defaults to the admin themselves, so the dialog is
 *    still one click for the common case.
 * 2. **No list of who is queued.** The design lists the queue by name. The
 *    contract exposes `waitlistCount` plus **the caller's own** position and
 *    deliberately nothing else: `waitlistUpdatedEventSchema` states that "who
 *    is queued for a spot is not public". Listing the names would need a
 *    procedure that does not exist and should not. The count and the caller's
 *    own position are shown instead.
