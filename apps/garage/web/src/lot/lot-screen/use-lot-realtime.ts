/**
 * Wires the day room's broadcasts onto the day overview in the query cache.
 *
 * The decisions all live in `./day-overview-cache` as pure functions; this
 * file is only the plumbing that reads the current cache entry, applies one,
 * writes it back and — when the event can have moved a viewer-relative field
 * — asks for a refetch. See that module's header for why both halves exist.
 *
 * Joining the room is here too, so a screen has exactly one call to make:
 * `useDayRoom` and the four listeners are the same subscription seen from two
 * angles, and splitting them across two hooks would make it possible to listen
 * without joining.

/**
 * Refetches the day the moment the socket comes back.
 *
 * **Why anything is needed at all.** The four handlers above patch the cache
 * from broadcasts. A broadcast published while the socket is down is not
 * queued anywhere — it is gone — and nothing else brings the entry back in
 * line: `libs/query` sets `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` and a 30 s
 * `staleTime`, and TanStack's `refetchOnReconnect` keys off `navigator.onLine`,
 * which says nothing about a socket that dropped for a reason other than the
 * network (an API restart, a proxy idle timeout, a laptop resume). Without
 * this the grid keeps drawing spots as free that somebody took during the gap,
 * until the user changes the date or writes something themselves.
 *
 * `use-cell-locks.ts` already handles the same event for locks — it empties the
 * map on a drop, because "unknown" must not be drawn as "nobody is editing".
 * This is the counterpart for the overview, where the honest recovery is to
 * ask the server again rather than to blank the screen.
 *
 * **An edge, not a level.** `useRealtime()` reports the current status only, so
 * the transition is derived here with a ref: any status other than `connected`
 * arms it, and the next `connected` fires and disarms it. A level check would
 * invalidate on every render while connected.
 *
 * The ref starts **disarmed**, and that is the whole difference between one
 * refetch and two on a page load. A hook mounting under an already-connected
 * socket (navigating between `/` and `/settings`, say) has missed nothing and
 * refetches nothing. A hook mounting on a cold page starts at `disconnected` —
 * `RealtimeProvider`'s initial status — which arms it, so the first `connected`
 * does fire: the window between the overview being fetched and the socket
 * finishing its handshake is a real gap, the same gap as any later one, and
 * this is the only thing that closes it.
