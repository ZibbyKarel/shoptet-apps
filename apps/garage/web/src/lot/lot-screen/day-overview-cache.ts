/**
 * How a realtime broadcast becomes a change to the day overview in the query
 * cache.
 *
 * `plan.md` (Fáze 6) requires **one** mechanism — "realtime events
 * invalidate/patch the query cache, no ad-hoc local state" — and this module
 * is the whole of it. The rule it implements, in one sentence:
 *
 * > **Patch the shared fields the payload determines; additionally invalidate
 * > when the event can move a viewer-relative field the broadcast is
 * > forbidden to carry.**
 *
 * The second half is not defensiveness, it is the contract. A day room is
 * shared by everybody looking at that day, so a payload may not say anything
 * viewer-relative — `waitlistUpdatedEventSchema` spells this out: "there is no
 * way to broadcast 'your position is now 2' to a room without telling everyone
 * else who is in the queue". `viewerWaitlistPosition`,
 * `viewerWaitlistEntryId`, `viewerReservationId` and `canReserve` therefore
 * cannot be patched from an event, and the only honest way to learn their new
 * values is to ask for the day again.
 *
 * Patching *and* invalidating is not redundant work: the patch repaints the
 * grid on the same tick the event arrived, and the refetch corrects the four
 * viewer fields a moment later. Invalidating alone would leave the tile stale
 * for a round trip; patching alone would leave "you are 2nd in the queue"
 * wrong indefinitely.
 *
 * Every function here is pure and returns the **same object reference** when
 * nothing changed, so an event for another day — a client is typically in
 * several day rooms, and Socket.io does not tell a handler which room a
 * message arrived through — costs one comparison and no re-render.
