   * failure describes one attempt, and an attempt the admin has walked away

   * `doc/decision/0167-*`.
   *

   * mutation that failed keeps answering for every later write, so a create
   * that was refused would report a retire that succeeded. Pinned by "does not
   * report a later, successful write with an earlier one's error".

   * not: it is only ever read while a mutation holds an error — and after this
   * function none does. A `setLastWrite(null)` here survived the whole web
   * suite, and worse, it let a test pass on the intent going missing instead of
