/**
 * Rooms, the editing hold, and what reaches whose browser — over real
 * WebSockets, against the assembled application.
 *
 * The suite runs against a **short** `REALTIME_LOCK_TTL_MS` so that a hold
 * lapsing is something a test can watch rather than something it has to
 * believe. That is a value, not a branch: `apps/garage/api/src/realtime/**` contains no
 * `NODE_ENV` check and no test flag, and `realtime-no-backdoor.spec.ts` asserts
 * it stays that way.
 *
 * Every test uses its **own cell**, and every wait matches on the payload as
 * well as the event name: with a sub-second TTL the server is legitimately
 * emitting `cell:unlocked` for cells earlier tests abandoned, and an assertion
 * that accepted any of them would pass for the wrong reason.
