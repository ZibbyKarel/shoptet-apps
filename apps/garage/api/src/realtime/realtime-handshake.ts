/**
 * Who may open a Socket.io connection: the handshake half of `doc/realtime.md`.
 *
 * This is the file that answers "why was my socket refused?". It owns the
 * credential schema, the rejection taxonomy, the single place a refusal is
 * logged, and the `UserSummary` an authenticated socket carries — everything
 * that changes when *authentication* changes (a new claim, a second issuer, a
 * different rejection reason). What a connected socket may then *do* — rooms,
 * the editing hold, the after-commit broadcast — changes for entirely
 * different reasons and lives in `realtime.gateway.ts`. The two share exactly
 * one thing: {@link RealtimeSocketData}, which this file writes and the
 * gateway reads.
 *
 * One guarantee `libs/garage/realtime-client` (Task 21) holds and this file is
 * responsible for honouring:
 *
 * **The token is read from `socket.handshake.auth.token`, and nowhere else.**
 * Not the query string (it lands verbatim in every proxy access log), not a
 * header (the browser `WebSocket` API cannot set one, so Socket.io would apply
 * it to the polling transport only and a socket that upgraded would silently
 * stop presenting its credential). `doc/decision/0060-*`.
 *
 * The companion guarantee — **a refusal must arrive as a CONNECT_ERROR, which
 * means middleware** (`doc/decision/0112-*`) — is a property of *where this is
 * installed*, so it stays with the installation: see
 * `RealtimeGateway.afterInit`, which registers {@link
 * RealtimeHandshakeAuthenticator.authenticate} as `server.use(...)` and turns
 * the error thrown here into `next(error)`.
