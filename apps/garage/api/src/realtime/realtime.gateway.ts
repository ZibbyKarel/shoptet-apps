/**
 * The Socket.io gateway: the server half of `doc/realtime.md`.
 *
 * **What a connected socket may do** — rooms, the editing hold, and the
 * after-commit broadcast. *Who may connect* is the other responsibility, and it
 * is `realtime-handshake.ts`: it changes when authentication changes, this file
 * changes when the realtime protocol does. The two meet at
 * {@link RealtimeSocketData}, which the handshake writes and this file reads.
 *
 * `libs/garage/realtime-client` (Task 21) shipped first and holds guarantees the
 * server is responsible for honouring. Four of them are not obvious from the
 * contract and each is called out where it is implemented:
 *
 * 1. **The token is read from `socket.handshake.auth.token`, and nowhere else.**
 *    See `realtime-handshake.ts`, which holds that guarantee and
 *    `doc/decision/0060-*` with it.
 * 2. **A refusal must arrive as a CONNECT_ERROR, which means middleware.**
 *    See {@link RealtimeGateway.afterInit}.
 * 3. **`cell:lock` must be acknowledged.** See {@link RealtimeGateway.cellLock}.
 * 4. **A lapsed hold must be broadcast.** See {@link RealtimeGateway.onModuleInit}
 *    and `doc/decision/0111-*`.
 *
 * ## Every inbound payload is validated, and the validation cannot be forgotten
 *
 * `CLIENT_TO_SERVER_EVENT_SCHEMAS` is the gateway's validation table, and every
 * handler below reaches it through the single {@link RealtimeGateway.accept}
 * call — there is no second path from a socket frame to a handler body. An
 * event whose payload fails is **dropped**: no state changes, and for the one
 * acknowledged command no acknowledgement is sent, so the client's own ack
 * timeout resolves it. `realtime.gateway.spec.ts` walks the registry and
 * asserts a handler exists for every key, so a command added to the contract
 * cannot be half-implemented here.
 *
 * ## Nothing is broadcast from inside a transaction
 *
 * The gateway is never called from inside one. Reservation and waitlist facts
 * arrive through `DomainEventPublisher`, whose implementations are only ever
 * invoked after `await $transaction(...)` has resolved — see
 * `reservations/reservation-events.ts` and `realtime.publisher.ts`.
