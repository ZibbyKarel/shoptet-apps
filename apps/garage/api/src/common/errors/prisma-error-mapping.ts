 * What a database error *means* — the vocabulary, the driver-adapter meta

 *
 * This is a **database** concern, not an HTTP one. It lived inside
 * `common/filters/contract-exception.filter.ts` until the module boundary was
 * corrected, which told every reader — by import path alone — that deciding
 * whether to re-run a transaction was a question about exception filtering. It
 * is not: the filter is one consumer of these answers, and the retry loop in
 * `ReservationsService.isRetryableConflict` is another.
 *
 * **A Prisma constraint violation becomes the domain error it actually is.**
 * `Reservation (parkingSpotId, date)` is unique in the database, which is what
 * makes double-booking impossible under concurrency; without the P2002 mapping
 * below, the losing request of that race would surface as a 500.
 *
 * Note the name. `common/prisma-mapping.ts` is a different module with a
 * confusingly close one: it maps database *rows* to contract shapes
 * (`toDateOnly`, `toContractSpot`, …). This file maps database *errors*.
