/**
 * The window state is *not* re-derived here.
 *
 * `monthLockState` / `isMonthOpen` in `@garage/shared-types` own the rule and
 * have their own exhaustive tests. What these tests pin is that this service
 * calls them with the right arguments — the settings from the database and
 * today in Europe/Prague — and shapes the answer the contract asks for. The
 * `delegates to shared-types` case makes that structural rather than a claim:
 * it compares this service's output against `monthLockState` called directly,
 * for every combination, so a hand-rolled copy of the rule here would have to
 * agree with the real one on all of them to pass.
