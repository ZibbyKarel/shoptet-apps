/**
 * The day overview — one request that paints the whole parking screen.
 *
 * `plan.md` and the contract are explicit that this is **one** query from the
 * client's side: the grid, the queue badges, the caller's own position and the
 * reservation-window banner all come back together. A screen assembled from four
 * round trips can render a day's grid against a window it fetched a second
 * earlier, and the two would disagree exactly when it matters — at the moment a
 * month opens or closes.
 *
 * ## Why the waitlist is read whole and counted here
 *
 * Three of the five fields per spot come from the same rows: how many people are
 * queued, whether the caller is one of them, and where in the queue they stand.
 * A `groupBy` for the counts plus a second query for the caller's position would
 * be two reads of the same data with nothing keeping them consistent, and the
 * position is defined by the *order* of the rows anyway (`createdAt`, then `id`
 * as the tiebreaker — the same order Task 13 promotes in). One ordered read of
 * one day's queue, counted in memory, is both cheaper and the only way the count
 * and the position cannot contradict each other.
