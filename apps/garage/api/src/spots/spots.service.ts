/**
 * Parking spots: one read for everybody, three mutations for admins.
 *
 * The rule that shapes this whole file is that **a spot is never deleted**.
 * `Reservation` and `WaitlistEntry` reference it with `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, and
 * `AuditLog` entries name it by id, so retiring one is `active: false`
 * (`doc/decision/0027-*`). Everything else follows from that: `spot.list`
 * filters on `active`, and `deactivate` has to refuse while the spot still holds
 * reservations — or queues — somebody is counting on.
