/**
 * The assembled application, listening, with the real `AppModule` behind it —
 * the boot sequence every "through the whole pipeline" spec needs.
 *
 * It was written out five times before this file existed
 * (`realtime/testing/realtime-test-app.ts` plus the inlined `beforeAll`s in
 * `orpc/orpc-pipeline.spec.ts`, `calendar/calendar-pipeline.spec.ts`,
 * `calendar/calendar-logging.spec.ts` and `auth/auth-pipeline.spec.ts`), and it
 * had already drifted: two of the five set only `THROTTLE_LIMIT` and inherited
 * whatever a previously-run spec file had left in `process.env` for the strict
 * tier. Five copies means that question has to be re-answered five times. Now
 * the {@link ApiTestAppOptions} argument is the *only* thing that differs
 * between call sites, and it says so by name.
 *
 * **Nothing here is a test backdoor.** The module under test is the real
 * `AppModule` and the HTTP server is the one `configureApp` builds. Only
 * environment *values* differ from production, and no code path does:
 *
 * - `AUTH_OKTA_ISSUER` points at an in-process OIDC server instead of Okta —
 *   exactly as dev and e2e point it at `mock-oauth2-server`;
 * - the throttle limits are effectively disabled, so a suite that sends a dozen
 *   requests is not measuring the rate limiter by accident;
 * - `DATABASE_URL` is present but unused, because `PrismaService` is replaced
 *   by the caller's in-memory store (Docker is not available to `api:test`).
 *
 * Spec-only support code, excluded from `tsconfig.app.json`.
