/**
 * The domain half of the Slack integration: what to say, and to whom.
 *
 * `SlackClient` knows how to talk to Slack and nothing about parking;
 * `slack-messages.ts` knows the Czech wording and nothing about the database;
 * this class is the seam that turns a committed fact into one of those messages
 * and hands it over. Splitting it that way is what lets the wording be tested
 * without a network and the retry be tested without a database.
 *
 * ## Everything here runs after `COMMIT`
 *
 * Every method reads the database, so calling one inside a transaction would
 * mean a second connection reading rows the first has not committed — but the
 * far worse problem is the Slack call itself. `reservation-events.ts` puts it
 * plainly: a websocket frame sent inside a transaction that then rolls back is
 * a mistake a client recovers from; **a Slack message that says "your spot is
 * ready" cannot be taken back**, and the person it lied to will drive to the
 * office. `ReservationsService.cancel` already publishes strictly outside the
 * retry loop, past `await`; nothing in this file may be called from anywhere
 * else.
 *
 * ## Failures this class turns into outcomes, and one it does not
 *
 * A missing spot row, an unreachable Slack, a user with no Slack account — all
 * of them return an outcome and log, never a rejection. `plan.md` is explicit
 * that a Slack failure never breaks a domain operation, and the cheapest way to
 * guarantee that at every *Slack* call site is to leave nothing to catch.
 *
 * That does not extend to the database reads above the Slack call in each
 * method (`spotLabel`, the user lookup, `collectDailySummary`'s three reads):
 * none of them is guarded, so a Prisma failure *does* reject the method — an
 * ordinary, expected way for this to fail, not a bug. `SlackDomainEventPublisher.detach`
 * is what actually keeps that off the request path (see its own comment); it is
 * not something this class promises on its own.
