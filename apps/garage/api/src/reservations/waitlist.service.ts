/**
 * The waitlist: queueing for a spot somebody else holds, and leaving that queue.
 *
 * Promotion **out** of a queue is not here and is never a client call — it
 * happens inside the cancellation that frees the spot
 * (`WaitlistPromotionService`).
 *
 * ## Why joining locks the reservation row
 *
 * "You may only queue for an occupied spot" is a read, and a read of a row
 * another transaction is in the middle of deleting is a read of something that
 * is about to stop being true:
 *
 * ```
 * T1 join (spot S, day D)               T2 cancel the reservation on S/D
 * ─────────────────────────             ─────────────────────────
 * SELECT reservation → found
 *                                       DELETE it, queue empty, COMMIT
 * INSERT waitlist entry     ← queued for a spot that is now free, forever
 * ```
 *
 * `SELECT … FOR SHARE` on that reservation is what closes it. `FOR SHARE`
 * rather than `FOR UPDATE` because several people may legitimately join the
 * same queue at once and must not be serialised against each other — they only
 * need to be serialised against the *deleter*, and a shared lock conflicts with
 * the exclusive one `DELETE` takes. If the cancel gets there first, this
 * statement waits for its commit and then sees no row, and the caller is
 * correctly told `SPOT_NOT_OCCUPIED`.
 *
 * There is no deadlock against the cancel path even though both take two locks:
 * cancel takes `Reservation` then `WaitlistEntry`, join takes `Reservation` and
 * then only *inserts* — and an insert waits on no existing row's lock. Nothing
 * ever waits in the other direction, so there is no cycle to close.

  /**
   * Joins the queue for an occupied spot.
   *
   * `RESERVATION_LIMIT_REACHED` is refused up front even though nothing is being
   * reserved: a promotion would hand the caller a second reservation on a day
   * they already have one, which the unique index would refuse — so the queue
   * would accept them and then silently never promote them. Refusing at the door
   * is the honest version of the same rule (see `joinWaitlistContract`).
   *
   * Unlike the other checks in this module, **this one has no index behind
   * it** — joining a queue never touches `Reservation`'s unique index, so a
   * reservation acquired elsewhere in the same instant this check passes is
   * not caught here. That is fine, not a gap: `WaitlistPromotionService`
   * re-checks eligibility at promotion time and skips such a candidate then,
   * so the worst case is a queue entry that (correctly) never promotes. See
   * `doc/waitlist.md` §"What happens under concurrency".
   *
   * **The target may be somebody else**, if the caller is an admin.
   * `assertMayNameWaitlistTarget` is the boundary, mirroring
   * `ReservationsService.create`'s `assertMayNameHolder`: every check below
   * that used to read `actor.id` — "already holds it", "already reserved that
   * day" — now reads `targetUserId`, because the question is always about the
   * person being queued, not the person submitting the form.

   * force-promoted into a reservation they had asked to leave, with no way out.
   * The reshuffle argument also cuts the other way: everyone behind you moves
   * *up*, which is nearer to cancellation (always allowed) than to creation.
