/**
 * The per-user, per-calendar-month cap on confirmed reservations.
 *
 * The *count* is a request-time computation, not stored state: no column holds
 * how much of the month somebody has used. The *cap* is an admin setting — the
 * `ReservationLimitSettings` singleton (`doc/decision/0312-*`) — and every path
 * that inserts a `Reservation` row for a real user (never a guest — a guest has
 * no `userId`, so no budget applies) loads it with
 * {@link readMonthlyReservationCap} and passes it to
 * `assertWithinMonthlyReservationCap`, which runs as the last check before the
 * insert, inside the same transaction that will do the insert.
 *
 * The cap is read **inside** that transaction rather than before it: see
 * {@link readMonthlyReservationCap}. `WaitlistPromotionService.promote` reads it
 * once above its candidate loop rather than per candidate; the reason is stated
 * at the loop, which is where anybody changing it is standing.
 *
 * The `pg_advisory_xact_lock` this takes is a new lock resource, but it is not
 * a disjoint one, and an earlier version of this comment claiming it could not
 * form a new cycle was wrong. Two holders go on to want row locks in the same
 * transaction: `WaitlistPromotionService.promote` takes it once per skipped
 * over-cap candidate while already holding a queue row `FOR UPDATE`, and
 * `BulkReservationService.confirmOnce` takes it and then has
 * `releaseOwnQueues` `DELETE` the caller's `WaitlistEntry` rows, which can
 * block on a queue row a concurrent `cancel` + `promote` holds `FOR UPDATE`
 * while that transaction blocks here. That is a real cycle, and PostgreSQL
 * resolves it by killing one side with `40P01`.
 *
 * The mitigation is a retry, not an ordering — no ordering is available,
 * because the key is month-scoped and the row locks are date-scoped:
 * `BulkReservationService.committedConfirm` re-runs the transaction on any
 * `isWriteConflict` and reports `CONFLICT` when the attempts run out, exactly
 * as `ReservationsService.cancel` does for the cycle in
 * `doc/decision/0065-*`. `doc/decision/0307-*` has the full analysis.
 *
 * Unlike the per-day rule (a real unique index, so an optimistic pre-check is
 * safe and `P2002` is the final arbiter), there is no constraint that could
 * reject an over-cap insert — the lock + recount inside it *is* the
 * authoritative check.
