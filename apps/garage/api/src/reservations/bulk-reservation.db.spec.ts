/**
 * Bulk booking against a real PostgreSQL 17 — the sequential half.
 *
 * The races are in `bulk-concurrency.db.spec.ts`. What is here is everything a
 * single caller can observe: that the preview writes nothing, that the
 * confirmation writes reservations, queue entries, audit rows and broadcasts,
 * that the window and the past-date rules reject the whole request while a
 * weekend rejects only its own day, and — with a forced interleaving — that a
 * day whose spot is taken mid-transaction falls onto the waitlist instead of
 * discarding the batch.
 *
 * ## Why the fixtures look the way they do
 *
 * **Spots are global.** The database is shared by every `*.db.spec.ts` in the
 * run, and a spot another suite seeded is an active spot this allocator will
 * consider. So nothing here asserts *which* spot was picked out of the whole
 * lot: it asserts the two things that really are this module's claims — that the
 * row the result names exists in the database with the fields the result gave
 * it, and that the preview and the confirmation agree with each other. Where one
 * specific spot has to win, it is made to win by a rule that beats the ordering
 * outright: the caller's `preferredParkingSpotId`. Which spot the *ordering*
 * picks is `bulk-allocator.spec.ts`'s subject, where it can be settled without a
 * database at all.
 *
 * **Days are not shared between cases.** Several cases fill a whole day or book
 * one, so each gets days of its own; a case that reused another's would pass or
 * fail depending on the order Jest happened to run them in. They all sit in
 * **January 2100**, a month nothing else in the suite touches, which also
 * happens to contain a weekday public holiday (`2100-01-01` is a Friday) — that
 * is what makes the `NOT_A_BUSINESS_DAY` case possible inside a single calendar
 * month, which the input schema requires.
 *
 * Run with `nx run api:test-db` after `docker compose --profile dev up -d`.
