/**
 * The bulk-booking allocator: which spot each selected day should get.
 *
 * Pure. It takes a snapshot of the world and returns a plan; it reads no
 * database, opens no transaction and has no clock. That is what lets
 * `reservation.previewBulk` and `reservation.confirmBulk` share one definition
 * of "what should happen" while differing only in whether anything is written —
 * and it is what makes the preference order testable by an ordinary unit test
 * rather than only through a live PostgreSQL.
 *
 * ## The order of preference, and why each step is where it is
 *
 * Per day, in this order (`doc/decision/0090-*`):
 *
 * 1. **Not a business day** → `UNAVAILABLE / NOT_A_BUSINESS_DAY`. First because
 *    it is the most durable fact: a Saturday is still a Saturday next month,
 *    whereas "every spot is taken" is true for an afternoon. Same reasoning as
 *    `ReservationPolicy.assertMayTakeDay`'s ordering.
 * 2. **The user already holds a reservation that day** → `UNAVAILABLE /
 *    ALREADY_HAS_RESERVATION`. Above the queue branch on purpose: queueing
 *    somebody who already has a spot would create an entry that can never be
 *    promoted (one reservation per user per day), which is exactly what
 *    `WaitlistService.join` refuses at the door.
 * 3. **No active spots at all** → `UNAVAILABLE / NO_SPOTS_AVAILABLE`. There is
 *    nothing to reserve *and* nothing to queue for, so it is neither of the two
 *    outcomes below.
 * 4. **The preferred spot, if it is free** → `SPOT_ASSIGNED`, `isPreferredSpot`.
 * 5. **The first free spot** in the canonical order below → `SPOT_ASSIGNED`.
 * 6. Otherwise **the shortest queue** → `QUEUED`, with the position the user
 *    would take (or already holds). The tiebreak there is the label *alone*,
 *    not the group-then-label order of steps 4–5 — see {@link shortestQueue}.
 *
 * ## Why the allocator sorts its own inputs
 *
 * Both orders it depends on — spots, and days — are re-derived here rather than
 * trusted from the caller:
 *
 * - **Spots** are sorted by group (`IT` before `SHARED`, from the declaration
 *   order of `PARKING_GROUPS`) then by `label`. A `findMany` that lost its
 *   `orderBy` would otherwise silently change which spot a bulk booking picks,
 *   and nothing would fail. `bulk-allocator.spec.ts` shuffles the input and
 *   asserts the same plan comes back.
 * - **Days** are processed in ascending date order, and that is **not
 *   cosmetic**: it is the lock ordering that keeps two concurrent
 *   `confirmBulk`s from deadlocking. Each transaction inserts its reservation
 *   keys in this order, so two of them acquire shared keys in the same
 *   sequence and no cycle can form. Process them in request order instead and
 *   two users submitting the same days in opposite orders deadlock — which
 *   `bulk-concurrency.db.spec.ts` § "a forced interleaving inside one multi-row
 *   INSERT" forces with a test-only `BEFORE INSERT` trigger. See
 *   `doc/decision/0092-*`.
 *
 *   **This line is the single authority for that order.** The plan's order is
 *   the row order of the reservation `INSERT` — `createReservations` maps
 *   straight off `plans` — so nothing between here and the write can reorder
 *   it. `BulkReservationService.assertRequestable` sorts too, but only locally,
 *   to name the earliest offending day in a rejection; it returns nothing, and
 *   the list it was handed reaches the allocator in request order on purpose. It
 *   used to return a sorted copy, and while it did, either sort could be deleted
 *   with every test still green.
 *
 * The plan therefore comes back in ascending date order. Putting it back into
 * the order the client asked for is the service's job, because the contract
 * promises the response in request order and the *writes* have to stay in this
 * one.
