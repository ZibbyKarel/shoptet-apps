/**
 * Two bulk bookings at once. Real transactions, real unique keys, real
 * deadlocks.
 *
 * A bulk confirmation holds up to 31 uncommitted `(parkingSpotId, date)` keys at
 * a time, which is Task 13's deadlock risk multiplied by the size of the batch.
 * What keeps it from being a problem is one line in `bulk-allocator.ts` — the
 * ascending sort, the single authority for the order the rows are written in —
 * and this file is where that line stops being an argument:
 *
 * - **the brief's case**: two users booking *the same days in opposite request
 *   order* both succeed, and the database agrees with what each of them was
 *   told;
 * - **the same case, with the statement broken open**: a test-only `BEFORE
 *   INSERT … FOR EACH ROW` trigger stalls between the rows of the multi-row
 *   `INSERT`, so each caller is holding one key while reaching for the other.
 *   They still both succeed — and they stop doing so the moment the sort is
 *   deleted, which is what makes the sort falsifiable end to end rather than
 *   only by a unit test;
 * - **the cycle itself**: a competitor that takes the same two cells in the
 *   opposite order really does deadlock against a confirmation, and when it
 *   happens the batch is all-or-nothing and the caller is told `CONFLICT`
 *   rather than being handed a 500.
 *
 * The last case is what makes the first one meaningful. Without it "both
 * succeeded" could just mean the two requests never met.
 *
 * The days are in **February 2100**, which nothing else in the suite touches,
 * for the same reason `bulk-reservation.db.spec.ts` uses January: spots are
 * global in this database but days do not have to be.

     * conflict (`doc/decision/0307-*`, added for the monthly cap's advisory-lock
     * cycle, but not narrowable to it — a `40P01` from a cell-ordering cycle and
