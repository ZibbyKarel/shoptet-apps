/**
 * The routing table and the contract must not drift.
 *
 * Each contract procedure is mounted on its own Nest route so that `@Roles()`
 * and `@CurrentUser()` keep working (`rpc-route-handler.ts`). The price of that
 * is a path written out in a decorator, and a path written by hand is a path
 * that can be wrong. This file is what makes it not be:
 *
 * - every registered RPC route names a procedure that exists in `libs/garage/contract`;
 * - every procedure Task 12 implements has exactly one route;
 * - every procedure it does not implement has **none** — so a half-added Task 13
 *   procedure fails here rather than answering 404 in production;
 * - every `admin.*` route carries `@Roles('ADMIN')` and no other route does;
 * - and, separately, that **the compiled application** registers no HTTP route
 *   at all beyond those procedures and a named allow-list.
 *
 * The `@Roles()` one is the reason this file is worth more than a lint rule. The
 * authorization of this API is a list of decorators; nothing else in the
 * codebase would notice one going missing.
 *
 * ## Why the last bullet is a separate describe
 *
 * Everything above it reads {@link CONTROLLERS}, a hand-maintained literal. That
 * is right for "every procedure has exactly one route" — the claim is about
 * those controllers — but the final review found a test titled *"registers no
 * route that the contract does not declare"* making a **global** claim off that
 * same list, and the Nx scaffold's `AppController` (`GET /api` →
 * `{"message":"Hello API"}`) sailed through it for not being in the list. The
 * controller is gone (`doc/decision/0239-*`); the missing check is the part that
 * would have caught the next one, and it can only come from the composed
 * application, so `the compiled application` below boots `AppModule` and
 * enumerates what Nest actually registered.
