/**
 * The append-only audit trail.
 *
 * Every admin action and every mutation that changes who may park where writes
 * one row here. That matters most for the operations that leave **no trace in
 * the data**: cancelling a reservation is a hard delete (`doc/decision/0027-*`),
 * so without an entry the row simply stops existing and nobody can say who
 * removed it or when.
 *
 * ## Append-only is enforced below this class, not by it
 *
 * There is deliberately no `update` and no `delete` here, but that is a
 * convenience, not the guarantee: two database triggers created by the init
 * migration reject `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE` against `AuditLog`
 * (`doc/decision/0027-*`). A service method is a rule anybody can route around
 * with `prisma.client.auditLog.deleteMany`; the trigger is not. What this class
 * owns is the *shape* of what goes in.
 *
 * ## Why `record` takes the client
 *
 * Task 13 writes its audit entries **inside** the interactive transaction that
 * cancels a reservation and promotes the next person in the queue: if the
 * transaction rolls back, the entry claiming it happened must roll back with it.
 * So the write runs on whatever client the caller is holding — the request-scoped
 * `PrismaService.client` by default, or a `Prisma.TransactionClient` when there
 * is one. That is why `record` is not simply `this.prisma.client.auditLog.create`.
