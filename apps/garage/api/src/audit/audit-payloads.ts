/**
 * What each audit action's `payload` contains.
 *
 * The `AuditLog` row carries a discriminant (`action`, the contract's closed
 * `AUDIT_LOG_ACTIONS` enum) and a JSONB bag beside it. Until this map existed
 * the two were unrelated: any writer of any action could put any keys in, and
 * two writers of the *same* action could disagree on the key names with nothing
 * failing. The table is append-only (`doc/decision/0027-*`), so a divergence is
 * permanent and unqueryable after the fact — and `doc/decision/0091-*` already
 * rules that an audit fact whose presence depends on which endpoint the row
 * arrived through is not an audit trail. The same argument applies one level
 * down, to the keys.
 *
 * Keyed as a `Record` over `AuditLogAction`, so adding an action to the
 * contract does not compile until somebody says what its payload holds.
 *
 * ## Why this is a TypeScript map and not a Zod schema in `libs/garage/contract`
 *
 * Contract-first governs FE↔BE shapes, and this is not one: no procedure
 * returns an `AuditLog`, so no payload written here ever crosses the wire or is
 * parsed. What the map *does* have to satisfy is Prisma's `InputJsonObject`
 * bound — a `Date`, a class instance or an `undefined` has no representation in
 * a JSONB column — and `libs/garage/contract` may not depend on `@garage/database`.
 * The discriminant itself still comes from the contract (`AuditLogAction`), as
 * do the field types that are contract shapes.
 *
 * Written as `type` aliases rather than `interface`s deliberately: only a type
 * alias of an object literal gets TypeScript's implicit index signature, which
 * is what makes it assignable to `Prisma.InputJsonObject` at the one place that
 * matters, `AuditLogService.record`.
