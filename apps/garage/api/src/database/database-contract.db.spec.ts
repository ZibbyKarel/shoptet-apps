/**
 * What the **database** does — pinned against a real PostgreSQL 17.
 *
 * Every other spec in `apps/garage/api` runs against `PrismaDouble`, an in-memory
 * stand-in. A double is fine for logic, but it must never be the only thing
 * that decides what a database *error* looks like, and this suite exists
 * because it once was: `PrismaDouble` fabricated `P2002` with a `meta.target`
 * key, the real `@prisma/adapter-pg` emits no such key, and every unique
 * violation therefore degraded to the vague `CONFLICT` — including
 * `SPOT_ALREADY_RESERVED`, which `plan.md` names as the concurrency guarantee
 * of the whole reservation flow. The mapping was unit-tested and green
 * throughout. Nothing short of a real connection could have caught it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate target
 *
 * `nx run-many -t test` has to stay runnable without Docker, so these tests are
 * **excluded** from the `api:test` target by `testPathIgnorePatterns` and run by
 * `nx run api:test-db` instead. They deliberately do **not** skip themselves
 * when `DATABASE_URL` is absent — a suite that skips into green is exactly the
 * false confidence this file was written to remove. No database, no run.
 *
 * ## Why nothing is left behind
 *
 * Every case runs inside an interactive transaction that is always rolled back:
 * the fixtures are created, the constraint is provoked, the error propagates out
 * of the callback and Prisma rolls the whole thing back. That is also the only
 * way to test the `AuditLog` triggers at all — the table rejects `DELETE`, so a
 * row inserted to test it could never be cleaned up any other way.
