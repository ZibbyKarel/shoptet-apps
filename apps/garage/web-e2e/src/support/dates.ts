 * Saturday, or falls on 28 October. All three make a reservation impossible
 * (`DayOverviewService.isReservableDay`) and would show up as a mystifying
 * failure months after the test was written.
 *
 * The rules are the application's own, imported from
 * `@garage/shared-types` — never re-implemented here:
 *
 * - the **month** must be open, and under `AUTO` the current month never is
 *   (its window closes the day before it starts), so the suite works in the
 *   *next* month, which `reset-e2e` guarantees is open by setting
 *   `openDaysBefore` to its maximum;
 * - the **day** must be a business day: `isBusinessDay` excludes weekends and
 *   Czech public holidays, which `isReservableDay` requires.
