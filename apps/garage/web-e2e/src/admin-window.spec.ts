/**
 * Reservation-window administration: the "Rezervační okno" tab of `/admin`
 * (`apps/garage/web/src/shell/admin/admin-window-screen/admin-window-screen.tsx`).
 *
 * This is a browser-layer journey rather than a unit test for one central
 * reason: the screen's own claim is that the month list on the right is "podle
 * nastavení vlevo" — a **live read** of the setting next to it — and that can
 * only be demonstrated by actually changing the setting, through the real
 * `admin.window.update` mutation, and watching the list on the same screen
 * follow it. `admin-window-screen.spec.tsx` and `window-view.spec.ts` already
 * pin the mapping from `(state, lockMode)` to wording as a pure function; this
 * file exists to prove the connected screen wires that function to a real
 * save and a real refetch, and that an ordinary user's own overview reacts the
 * same way theirs does.
 *
 * ## Why `FORCE_LOCKED` is deliberately absent from this file
 *
 * The reservation-window settings row is a **global singleton**, shared by
 * every spec file running concurrently under `fullyParallel: true`.
 * `FORCE_LOCKED` ("Vynutit uzamčeno") would close the target month for every
 * other spec's bookings, and lowering `openDaysBefore` below the seeded
 * maximum (`MAX_OPEN_DAYS_BEFORE`, 31 — `libs/garage/database/src/scripts/reset-e2e.ts`)
 * would do the same by a different route. Neither is exercised here — this
 * file only ever moves between `AUTO` and `FORCE_OPEN`, which keeps the lot
 * open no matter what. The `FORCE_LOCKED` rule itself is already covered where
 * it is enforced: `apps/garage/api/src/reservations/reservation-policy.spec.ts`,
 * `reservations.db.spec.ts`, and `day-overview.service.spec.ts`.
 *
 * ## Serial, and why
 *
 * Not for isolation from other spec files — there is none, the settings row
 * is shared by design — but because this file's own story is a sequence: the
 * month list is asserted under `AUTO`, then under `FORCE_OPEN`, then across a
 * reload, and a later test's premise (`FORCE_OPEN` is active) must not race a
 * `test.describe`-level worker running an earlier one out of order.
 * `test.afterAll` restores `AUTO` unconditionally, exactly the way
 * `admin-users.spec.ts` restores its own mutable fixture — so a run that
 * starts after an earlier one was interrupted mid-file still ends up with the
 * month open for everybody, rather than depending on `prisma db seed` alone.
