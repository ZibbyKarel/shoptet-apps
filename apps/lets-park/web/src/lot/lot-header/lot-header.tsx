 * - **Dropped**, and reconnecting on its own. `onReconnect` is omitted and the
 *   notice is the quieter, buttonless variant: a control that duplicates what
 *   is already in progress invites a click that changes nothing.
 *
 * One `realtimeRejected` string covers both. The key is named for the state it
