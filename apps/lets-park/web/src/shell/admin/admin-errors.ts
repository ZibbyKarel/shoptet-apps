/**
 * What a failed admin **write** says, per operation.
 *
 * ## Why not `t('errors.' + code)`
 *
 * Because the same contract code means different things on different
 * procedures, and a sentence that is true for one is a false explanation on the
 * other. `CONFLICT` is the clearest case:
 *
 * | procedure                | what `CONFLICT` actually is                       |
 * | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
 * | `admin.user.update`      | the last active administrator would be gone       |
 * | `admin.spot.create`      | the label is already painted on another spot      |
 * | `admin.spot.update`      | a duplicate label **or** a spot still held today  |
 * | `admin.spot.deactivate`  | somebody holds the spot from today onwards        |
 * | `admin.window.update`    | nothing the client can cause; a concurrent write  |
 * | `admin.reservationLimits.update` | nothing the client can cause; a concurrent write |
 *
 * The `errors` namespace has one sentence per code, written for a reader with
 * no context — right for a screen that failed to load (`ScreenError`), wrong
 * here. Its `VALIDATION_FAILED` even says "weekend or holiday", which has
 * nothing to do with renaming a parking spot.
 *
 * So the mapping is by **(operation, code)** and it is a table, not a chain of
 * conditionals — a table can be read against the contract's `.errors(...)`
 * declarations to see what is missing.
 *
 * ## `admin.spot.update` is three operations, not one
 *
 * One procedure, three intents, and `CONFLICT` means something different in
 * each: renaming can collide with another label, switching a spot **off** can
 * collide with a live reservation, and switching one **on** can collide with
 * neither. The caller says which it asked for; nothing in the response could.
 *
 * ## The fallback never guesses
 *
 * A code with no entry (or a transport failure, which has no code at all) gets
 * the operation's `errFallback*`: "it did not save, try again". That is true of
 * anything unexpected. Falling through to a specific sentence would be the bug
 * this file exists to avoid.
