/**
 * Turning database rows into the shapes the contract declares.
 *
 * The two representations differ in exactly the ways `doc/database.md` lists
 * under "Where storage differs from the contract", and this is the single place
 * that crosses that gap:
 *
 * | column | contract |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `DateTime @db.Timestamptz(3)` | ISO 8601 string (`doc/decision/0015-*`) |
 * | `DateTime @db.Date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` (`doc/decision/0003-*`) |
 *
 * Every function below returns a value typed by `z.infer` from
 * `libs/lets-park/contract` — never a hand-written interface — so a field added to an
 * entity schema stops compiling here until it is mapped.
 *
 * ## The `@db.Date` convention
 *
 * A `DATE` column has no time and no zone. Postgres hands `@prisma/adapter-pg`
 * the text `YYYY-MM-DD` (its `normalize_date` is the identity function), and
 * Prisma turns that into a `Date` at **UTC** midnight. {@link toDateOnly} reads
 * it back with UTC getters for that reason: using local getters would move the
 * day by one for any process running west of Greenwich. No time-zone conversion
 * should happen at all here — the calendar day is already the value.
 *
 * `toDateOnlyInPrague` would in fact return the same day for every `@db.Date`,
 * and an earlier version of this comment claiming otherwise was wrong: Prague is
 * UTC+1 or UTC+2, always *ahead* of UTC, so UTC midnight is 01:00 or 02:00 on
 * the **same** Prague day and is never moved forward. (Measured across both DST
 * Sundays, a leap day, a new year and both offsets; the two functions diverge
 * only for instants that are not midnight UTC, which a `@db.Date` never is.)
 * `toDateOnly` is the right call because it is the one that says what this value
 * is, not because the other would give a wrong date.
 *
 * Task 13 exercised this against a real PostgreSQL 17 rather than leaving it as
 * an argument: `reservations.db.spec.ts` writes a reservation through
 * {@link toDateColumn} and asserts the stored column reads back as
 * `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00.000Z` — the same calendar day, not the one either side of
 * it.
