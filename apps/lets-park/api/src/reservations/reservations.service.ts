/**
 * Single-day reservations: taking a spot, and giving it back.
 *
 * The whole risk of this task is in {@link ReservationsService.cancel}. Creating
 * is a guarded insert; cancelling is a delete that may hand the freed spot
 * straight to somebody else, inside one transaction, while other requests are
 * doing the same thing to neighbouring rows.
 *
 * ## Three concurrency guarantees, and which mechanism provides each
 *
 * | rule | mechanism |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | one reservation per spot per day | unique index `Reservation (parkingSpotId, date)` |
 * | one reservation per user per day | unique index `Reservation (userId, date)` |
 * | the queue is served in order, once | `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` in `WaitlistPromotionService` |
 *
 * None of the three is a check in this file, and that is deliberate. A
 * read-then-write check cannot be made safe against a concurrent writer, so
 * every check below is a way of producing a *better error message* than the
 * index would, never the thing that enforces the rule. Where the two disagree
 * — because a writer committed between the read and the write — the index wins
 * and `mapUniqueConstraintViolation` turns its `P2002` into the same contract
 * code the check would have produced.
 *
 * ## Why cancellation retries
 *
 * The one place a `P2002` is genuinely *transient* is promotion. The queue is
 * locked and the candidate's other reservations are read inside the
 * transaction, but a reservation for that candidate can still be committed by
 * another request between the read and the promoting insert — a second
 * cancellation, on a different spot, whose queue that same person heads.
 *
 * Retrying the whole transaction is the answer rather than catching the error
 * inside it: a failed statement aborts a Postgres transaction, so there is no
 * "continue with the next candidate" available without savepoints, which the
 * Prisma client does not expose.
 *
 * **The retry terminates.** Each attempt re-reads the queue, and the reservation
 * that caused the previous attempt to fail is by then committed — so the
 * candidate that lost is skipped by {@link WaitlistPromotionService}'s own
 * eligibility read, and the attempt makes strictly more progress than the last.
 * With N people queued for a cell, at most N candidates can be eliminated this
 * way. {@link MAX_CANCEL_ATTEMPTS} bounds it anyway, because a bound that
 * depends on an argument about somebody else's code is not a bound.
 *
 * **When the retry itself loses**, the caller gets `CONFLICT` — a declared error
 * on `reservation.cancel`, and a 409, so the client is told it lost a race and
 * may try again, rather than being told the server broke. What it does *not* do
 * is cancel without promoting: a partial outcome is exactly what one transaction
 * exists to rule out.
 *
 * ## Nothing that can block on the network happens inside the transaction
 *
 * The callback returns the events it wants emitted; they are published after
 * `await` resolves. See `reservation-events.ts`.

   * eligibility read and its insert.
   *
   * **A deadlock** (`40P01`). Found by `waitlist-concurrency.db.spec.ts`, not by
   * reasoning, and worth spelling out because it is not obvious. Two
   * cancellations on different spots, same day, whose queues are headed by the
   * same person:

   * FOR UPDATE on A's queue  ✓             FOR UPDATE on B's queue  ✓
   * INSERT reservation for W ✓
   *                                        INSERT reservation for W  → waits on

   * DELETE W's queue entries for the day
   *   → waits on B's queue row, held by T2
   * ```
   *
   * A cycle, so PostgreSQL kills one of them. The cross-cell `DELETE` is
   * required by the rule ("their other waitlist entries for that day are
   * deleted"), and no ordering of the locks *this design* takes removes it — a
   * transaction cannot know which cells it will have to reach into until it has
   * read the queue. (An ordering that would remove it exists — locking the
   * whole day's queue rows in canonical order — but that is functionally the
   * `pg_advisory_xact_lock` upgrade path documented as the alternative, not a
   * variant of the current locking.) Retrying is the documented remedy, and it
   * converges for the same reason the `P2002` retry does: the winner's
   * reservation is committed by then, so the retry skips that candidate and
   * never reaches for the other cell at all.
   *
   * Which of the two statements the server picks as the victim is not ours to
   * choose, and it decides how the failure is *spelled*: the promotion's
   * `INSERT` is Prisma's own SQL and comes back `P2034`, while the cross-cell
   * `DELETE … RETURNING` is a `$queryRaw` and comes back `P2010` wrapping the
   * same `40P01`. Both are the identical condition and both must be retried,
   * which is why the test is {@link isWriteConflict} and not `code === 'P2034'`.
   * Getting that wrong made half of `waitlist-concurrency.db.spec.ts`'s
   * concurrent-cancellation runs fail — `doc/decision/0240-*`.
   *
   * See `doc/decision/0065-*` for the full deadlock analysis and the
   * advisory-lock upgrade path.
   *
   * `SPOT_ALREADY_RESERVED` is deliberately **not** retryable: it would mean
   * somebody took the cell this transaction was in the middle of freeing, which
   * the unique index makes impossible while our delete is uncommitted. If it
   * ever happened it would be a defect, and retrying a defect only makes it
