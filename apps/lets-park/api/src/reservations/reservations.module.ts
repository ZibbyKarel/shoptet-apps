/**
 * Reservations, the waitlist and bulk booking, which are one module because they
 * are one transaction: cancelling a reservation promotes out of the waitlist,
 * and splitting them would mean either a circular import or a promotion that
 * could not share the cancellation's transaction. Bulk booking joins them
 * because it writes into both tables at once and shares the same policy, the
 * same audit shape and the same after-commit publisher.
 *
 * The window settings come from `ReservationWindowModule` rather than being
 * re-read here, for the same reason the day overview borrows them: one
 * definition of whether a month is open. `ReservationLimitsModule` is imported
 * on the same grounds: the month summary reports the monthly cap in force, and
 * one definition of it is the point.
 *
 * ## The one after-commit seam, with both implementations behind it
 *
 * `DomainEventPublisher` is an abstract class used as the injection token
 * rather than a `Symbol`, so the seam is discoverable from the type and a
 * replacement cannot silently have the wrong shape. Task 13 bound it to
 * `NoopDomainEventPublisher`; Task 15 (Socket.io broadcasts) and Task 16
 * (outbound Slack) each then claimed it, and each predicted the collision in a
 * comment. Nest resolves one provider per token, so the resolution is not a
 * choice between them: it is {@link CompositeDomainEventPublisher}, bound here
 * and fanning every fact out to both.
 *
 * The delegate list is built by a factory injecting the *concrete* publisher
 * classes, which `RealtimeModule` and `SlackModule` provide and export. That is
 * what preserves the guarantee Task 16 needed `useExisting` for: the Slack
 * publisher is the instance `SlackModule` built, not a second one Nest would
 * construct here — which would resolve, keep its own in-flight set, and fail on
 * the collaborators that module deliberately does not export. The same holds
 * for the realtime publisher, which needs the gateway `RealtimeModule` owns.
 * `slack.module.spec.ts` and `realtime.gateway.spec.ts` both check the identity
 * end-to-end, through the composite, rather than trusting this paragraph.
 *
 * **No call site changed**, and nothing about *when* the seam is called was
 * ever up to its implementation: the services below compute events inside the
 * transaction and publish strictly after `COMMIT`, outside the cancel retry
 * loop. The composite cannot move that, and does not need to know it.
 *
 * Ordering in the list is delivery order, not precedence — every delegate is
 * called for every event regardless of what the ones before it did. See
 * `composite-domain-event.publisher.ts` for why each forward gets its own
 * `try`.
