/**
 * Auto-promotion: handing a freed spot to the first person queued for it.
 *
 * This runs **inside** the caller's transaction — it takes a
 * `Prisma.TransactionClient`, never `PrismaService` — because the promotion and
 * the cancellation that freed the spot have to share a fate. A promotion that
 * committed while its cancellation rolled back would hand out a spot somebody
 * still holds; a cancellation that committed while its promotion rolled back
 * would silently skip the queue.
 *
 * ## Why a row lock, and what exactly it prevents
 *
 * The queue is read with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` through `$queryRaw`, ordered by
 * `WAITLIST_ORDER_SQL` (`waitlist-order.ts`) — the same order `DayOverviewService`
 * shows people as their position, so the number in the UI is the number that
 * gets promoted.
 *
 * The lock is not there to stop two promotions of the same spot: two
 * reservations for one spot and day cannot coexist (unique index), so two
 * cancellations of the same cell cannot be in flight at once. It is there for
 * the race against **`waitlist.leave`**:
 *
 * ```
 * T1 cancel+promote                     T2 leave (W1)
 * ─────────────────────────             ─────────────────────────
 * read queue → [W1, W2]
 *                                       DELETE W1's entry
 *                                       COMMIT
 * INSERT reservation for W1   ← W1 is given a spot they opted out of
 * ```
 *
 * With `FOR UPDATE`, T2's `DELETE` blocks on the row T1 has locked until T1
 * commits, and then deletes nothing (the promotion already removed it), so T2
 * answers `NOT_FOUND` — which is the truth: they were promoted before they left.
 * If T2 gets there first, T1's locking read simply never sees the row and W2 is
 * promoted instead. Both orderings are correct; without the lock the first one
 * is not. `waitlist-concurrency.db.spec.ts` ("the row lock on the queue") drives
 * exactly this interleaving with two real transactions and a barrier, and the
 * mutation result — `FOR UPDATE` deleted, the departed waiter promoted, the test
 * red — is pasted in the task report.
 *
 * ## The candidate the queue may not give
 *
 * "First in line" is not enough: a person may hold a reservation elsewhere that
 * same day, and promoting them would break the one-reservation-per-user-per-day
 * rule. Such a candidate is **skipped**, not failed — the spot goes to the next
 * person. Their queue entry is deliberately left in place: they are still
 * legitimately waiting for *this* spot in case their other reservation goes
 * away.
 *
 * That check is a read, and a read cannot be made race-free against a concurrent
 * `INSERT` of a row that does not exist yet — Postgres has no predicate lock
 * outside `SERIALIZABLE`. So the unique index on `Reservation (userId, date)` is
 * the real arbiter, it raises `P2002`, and `ReservationsService.cancel` retries
 * the whole transaction. See its comment for why the retry terminates.
