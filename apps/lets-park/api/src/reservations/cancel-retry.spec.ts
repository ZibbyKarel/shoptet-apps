/**
 * What happens when the retry itself keeps losing.
 *
 * Everything else about cancellation is tested against a real PostgreSQL, and
 * should be. This one case cannot be: it needs a conflict to recur
 * {@link MAX_CANCEL_ATTEMPTS} times in a row, and a real race that is *forced*
 * to be lost three times running is not a race any more — it is a stub with
 * extra steps and a database attached.
 *
 * So the transaction is the stub here, and nothing else is: the service under
 * test is the real one, and the error it is fed is the shape
 * `database-contract.db.spec.ts` pins against PostgreSQL 17 on every
 * `api:test-db`. That is the arrangement this project learned to insist on — a
 * double may stand in for *when* an error arrives, never for what one looks
 * like.
 *
 * The two claims:
 *
 * 1. it stops. `MAX_CANCEL_ATTEMPTS` attempts, not an unbounded loop holding row
 *    locks forever;
 * 2. it stops with `CONFLICT`, not with the underlying
 *    `RESERVATION_LIMIT_REACHED` — which would tell the caller *they* have a
 *    reservation-limit problem when in fact somebody they have never heard of
 *    does.
