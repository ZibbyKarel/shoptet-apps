/**
 * Bulk booking: `reservation.previewBulk` and `reservation.confirmBulk`.
 *
 * One allocator (`bulk-allocator.ts`, pure), two callers. The preview runs it
 * against a snapshot and returns the plan; the confirmation runs it inside one
 * interactive transaction and then writes what it can. Nothing about *which*
 * spot a day should get lives in this file — that is the whole point of the
 * split, because a preview that predicted a different spot from the one the
 * confirmation takes would be worse than no preview at all.
 *
 * ## `previewBulk` writes nothing
 *
 * No transaction, no lock, no row. It is a read of the same four things the
 * confirmation reads, handed to the same function. `bulk-reservation.db.spec.ts`
 * asserts that by counting `Reservation`, `WaitlistEntry` and `AuditLog` rows
 * either side of a preview and requiring all three to be unchanged — a claim a
 * return-value assertion could never make.
 *
 * It still refuses a locked month and a past day, because a plan the caller can
 * never confirm is not a useful answer, and because the contract declares those
 * errors on both procedures for exactly that reason.
 *
 * ## `confirmBulk` never lets a statement fail
 *
 * The rule is: **one day colliding must not discard the batch**. Task 13
 * established why that is hard — a failed statement aborts a PostgreSQL
 * transaction, and Prisma exposes no savepoints, which is why
 * `ReservationsService.cancel` retries the whole transaction rather than
 * catching a `P2002` inside it.
 *
 * So this transaction never raises one. Both write phases go through
 * `createManyAndReturn({ skipDuplicates: true })` — `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO
 * NOTHING RETURNING …` — so a cell somebody took between the preview and the
 * confirmation comes back as a **missing row**, not as an error. The transaction
 * stays alive, that day falls to the waitlist, and the result says so. No
 * statement in this transaction may raise, and the retry loop below is not a
 * licence for one to start: it catches deadlocks the server itself raises
 * (see below), never a `P2002` this file could have avoided.
 *
 * ## Deadlock: the ascending-date order is the lock ordering
 *
 * A bulk confirmation touches up to 31 `(spot, date)` cells, which is up to 31
 * uncommitted unique keys held at once — Task 13's deadlock risk, multiplied.
 * What removes the cycle is that **every** confirmation acquires those keys in
 * ascending date order, and that each date takes at most **one** reservation
 * key: a transaction waiting at date *d* holds no key at date *d*, so two of
 * them cannot each hold what the other wants. Two users submitting the same days
 * in opposite request order therefore serialise instead of deadlocking.
 *
 * That order has exactly **one** authority: `allocateBulk`'s
 * `[...request.dates].sort(compareDateOnly)`, whose output order *is* the row
 * order of the `INSERT` (`createReservations` maps straight off `plans`). The
 * service does not sort for it: `assertRequestable` sorts only locally, to name
 * the earliest offending day in a rejection, and does not reorder the list the
 * allocator sees — that stays `input.dates`, in request order. There was once a
 * second sort there whose returned list fed the allocator, which meant *either*
 * sort could be deleted with every test still green — measured, not assumed. See
 * `doc/decision/0092-*` §"One authority".
 *
 * The remaining sort is pinned directly by `bulk-allocator.spec.ts` ("comes back
 * in ascending date order, whatever order it was asked in"). It *used* to be
 * pinned end to end as well, by `bulk-concurrency.db.spec.ts` › "a forced
 * interleaving inside one multi-row INSERT", which breaks a multi-row `INSERT`
 * between its rows with a test-only `BEFORE INSERT` trigger and deadlocked the
 * moment the sort went. That pin is now weakened, not removed: `committedConfirm`
 * retries a `40P01`, and the retry cannot tell a cell-ordering cycle from the
 * monthly cap's, so a missing sort surfaces only if the retries lose too — which
 * has not been re-measured. Treat `bulk-allocator.spec.ts` as the sort's only
 * reliable guard and see `doc/decision/0307-*` §"What is not tested".
 *
 * This path takes no `FOR UPDATE` of its own, but that no longer keeps it out of
 * the cancel/promote wait graph in `doc/decision/0065-*`, and the claim that it
 * did is retracted. Since the monthly cap, `confirmOnce` takes a month-scoped
 * `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on `(userId, month)` and then, in `releaseOwnQueues`,
 * `DELETE`s that user's `WaitlistEntry` rows — which can block on a queue row a
 * concurrent `cancel` + `promote` is holding `FOR UPDATE` while *that*
 * transaction blocks on our advisory lock. A real cycle, rare but not
 * impossible, and month scope is exactly what defeats the date-confinement
 * argument the deadlock table in `doc/bulk-reservation.md` used to rest on.
 *
 * The resolution is a retry, not an ordering: `committedConfirm` re-runs the
 * whole transaction on any {@link isWriteConflict}, and reports `CONFLICT` when
 * the attempts run out. See `doc/decision/0307-*` and the deadlock table in
 * `doc/bulk-reservation.md`.
 *
 * ## The one race this deliberately does not close
 *
 * `waitlist.join` takes `SELECT … FOR SHARE` on the reservation of the cell it
 * is queueing for, so a caller cannot be queued for a spot a concurrent
 * cancellation is in the middle of freeing. Bulk booking does **not**: locking
 * one reservation row per selected day would add up to 31 more locks to a
 * transaction whose lock footprint is the whole reason this file is careful, and
 * would put it back into the cancel path's wait graph.
 *
 * The consequence is bounded and self-correcting. A day the allocator decided to
 * queue can, in the window between the read and the insert, have its spot freed
 * — leaving the caller queued for a spot that is free. They are not stuck: the
 * spot is visible on the day screen and they can simply reserve it, and if
 * somebody else takes it first the queue entry becomes meaningful again. Days
 * that queue because they *lost* a race are not affected at all: they queue for
 * the spot whose insert was refused, which is occupied by definition. Same
 * shape of documented, benign gap as `WaitlistService.join`'s
 * `RESERVATION_LIMIT_REACHED` pre-check — see `doc/bulk-reservation.md`.
 *
 * ## Nothing that can block on the network happens inside the transaction
 *
 * Same seam as Task 13: the callback returns its events, and they are published
 * after `await` has resolved. See `reservation-events.ts`.
