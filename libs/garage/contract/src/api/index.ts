/**
 * Named, not a star. The tools a procedure is *defined* with — `authed`,
 * `contractErrors`, `noInputSchema`, `NoInput` in `./builder`, and
 * `errorDataSchema` in `./errors` — are deliberately not among them:
 * publishing them from `@garage/contract` makes "define a procedure outside
 * `libs/garage/contract`" a supported move, which is the one thing the contract-first
 * rule exists to make impossible. They stay inside the lib, where every module
 * that defines a procedure reaches the builders through `./builder`, as do
 * `builder.spec.ts` and `router.spec.ts`.
 *
 * `ERROR_DEFINITIONS` is different in kind: it is the code→status→message
 * table a consumer legitimately reads, and both apps do
 * (`ContractExceptionFilter`, `DomainError`, `toContractError`).
 *
 * `./bulk` is named rather than starred for the same reason: its day-member
 * and summary schemas exist only to compose `bulkDayPlanSchema` /
 * `bulkDayResultSchema` and stay behind the barrel, while the types
 * consumers actually annotate with (down to `BulkBookingSummary`, the one
 * whose schema stays private but whose inferred type does not) are still
 * published.
