/**
 * The whole API contract, assembled.
 *
 * This object is the binding list of what the backend may implement and what
 * the frontend may call. `apps/garage/api` (Task 12) implements it, `libs/shared/api-client`
 * (Task 11) types the client from it, and nothing outside it may exist.
 *
 * Grouping follows who calls it, not which table it touches: everything under
 * `admin` requires `role: 'ADMIN'`, everything else is available to any active
 * user. That is why spot reads appear twice — `spot.list` for the settings
 * picker, `admin.spot.list` for the management table with its filters.

/**
 * The whole contract as a **callable client**: every procedure above, with its
 * input, output and declared error codes derived from the Zod schemas.
 *
 * This alias lives here rather than in `libs/shared/api-client` on purpose.
 * `ContractRouterClient` comes from `@orpc/contract`, and that package is
 * allow-listed for the `type:contract` tag **only** (`NPM_ALLOWLIST.contract` in
 * `eslint.config.mjs`, which is deliberately narrow — see
 * `doc/decision/0007-*`). Applying it here means `libs/shared/api-client` can type its
 * client without `@orpc/contract` being opened up to every `type:util` lib,
 * which would also have handed it to `libs/shared/form`, `libs/shared/i18n` and every wrapper
 * still to come.
 *
 * It is a **type**, so nothing of `@orpc/contract` reaches the runtime through
 * it: the transport still comes from `@orpc/client`, which only
 * `libs/shared/api-client` may import. Exporting a type from the contract lib is also
 * what this lib is for — `Contract` itself is already exported the same way.
 *
 * `TClientContext` stays at its default (`Record<never, never>`): every request
 * carries the same bearer token, resolved by the client's own token provider,
 * so there is nothing a call site needs to thread through.
