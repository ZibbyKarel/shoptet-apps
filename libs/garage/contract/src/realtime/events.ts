/**
 * Payload schemas of the **server → client** realtime events.
 *
 * Naming, settled here for the whole project (Task 5 brief asks for it):
 *
 * - `<subject>:<past participle>` — every one of these announces something that
 *   has **already happened and is already committed**. Task 15 broadcasts only
 *   after the transaction commits, and the past tense is what says so. Commands
 *   travelling the other way are imperative (`cell:lock`), so a name alone tells
 *   you which direction it belongs to; see `./commands`.
 * - `:` as the separator, lower case, singular subject, no verb tense mixing.
 * - The subject is a **domain** noun, except `cell`, which is deliberate: the
 *   editing hold is held on the pair (`parkingSpotId`, `date`) — one cell of the
 *   day × spot grid — and neither `spot:` nor `reservation:` names that pair.
 *   `spot:locked` would read as "this spot is locked on every day", which is a
 *   different (and non-existent) thing. `plan.md` and the Task 24 brief already
 *   call it a "cell-lock".
 *
 * **`locked` here has nothing to do with `MonthLockState.LOCKED`.** That is the
 * reservation window closing for a whole month; this is one user editing one
 * cell for the next ~30 seconds. No payload below carries a window state, and
 * no window state is ever broadcast — see `doc/contract.md`, §Realtime.
 *
 * Every payload repeats `date` even though the room already implies it: a
 * client is typically joined to several day rooms, and Socket.io does not tell
 * a handler which room a message arrived through.
 *
 * Every payload is **broadcast to a whole day room**, so nothing viewer-relative
 * (`viewerWaitlistPosition`) and nothing secret (`icsToken`, `email`, `oktaId`)
 * may appear in one. Other users are exposed through `userSummarySchema` only.
