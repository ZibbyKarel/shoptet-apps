/**
 * The two Socket.io event maps, plus the schema registries they are derived

 *
 * Socket.io types a connection as `Server<ClientToServerEvents,
 * ServerToClientEvents>` (and, on the client, the two reversed), where each map
 * is an object whose values are **function types** — `(payload) => void`. A
 * function type is not something Zod can describe, so the maps below are the
 * one place in the contract that is not itself a schema.
 *
 * They are still not hand-written. Each map is a **mapped type over a registry
 * of Zod schemas**, so every payload type is a `z.infer` (global constraint 1)
 * and the two artefacts cannot drift: adding an event means adding one line to
 * a registry, and both the runtime validation table and the compile-time
 * handler signature follow from it. Registering an event and forgetting to
 * validate it is not expressible.
