/**
 * Puts the development database into the state the Playwright suite expects.
 *
 * Run from the repo root, with `DATABASE_URL` in the environment:
 *
 * ```
 * npx nx run database:reset-e2e
 * ```
 *
 * `apps/garage/web-e2e`'s `globalSetup` runs it (as a subprocess) before the browsers
 * start. Two things make that a subprocess rather than an import:
 *
 * 1. `libs/garage/database` is tagged `scope:api` and `apps/garage/web-e2e` is `scope:web`,
 *    so the module boundary — rightly — forbids the import. A test app is not a
 *    reason to weaken it.
 * 2. The Prisma client then never loads inside a Playwright worker, where it
 *    would hold a connection pool open for the length of the run.
 *
 * ## What it changes, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * - **Deletes** every reservation and queue entry in the e2e target month (see
 *   {@link e2eTargetMonth}). Scoped to that month rather than truncating the
 *   tables, so a developer's own data on other days survives a test run.
 * - **Widens the reservation window** to {@link MAX_OPEN_DAYS_BEFORE} days, in
 *   `AUTO` mode. This is a *setting an admin can set in the UI*, not a
 *   test-only switch: with the seeded 7 days no month is bookable except during
 *   the last week of the preceding one, so on most days of the year a normal
 *   user could not create a reservation at all and half the scenarios would
 *   have nothing to exercise. At 31 days the *next* month is always open under
 *   the ordinary `AUTO` rule (its window starts on or before the first of the
 *   current month and ends on its last day), which is what the suite books
 *   into. See `doc/decision/0181-*`.
 * - **Deletes every parking spot that is not one of the nine seeded ones**,
 *   together with any reservation or queue entry on it. That is a spot an
 *   interrupted run of the spot-administration spec created and did not clean
 *   up, and nothing else would ever remove it: the seed is upserts on the
 *   natural key, so it restores the nine and is silent about a tenth.
 * - Touches **no seeded spot, and no user or role**: `prisma db seed` owns
 *   those, is idempotent, and `globalSetup` runs it first — so a role or an
 *   `active` flag an admin spec changed heals itself before the next run.
 *
 * ## What stops it doing that to a real database
 *
 * {@link assertDisposableDatabase}, run before anything else, and the target
 * host is printed either way. "Delete a month of reservations" is not a thing
 * that should ever be one stray environment variable away from a real database.
 *
 * This file used to say the same sentence and then check
 * `NODE_ENV === 'production'`, which is **inert in exactly the situation it
 * existed for**: `NODE_ENV` is unset in a plain shell, `nx run
 * database:reset-e2e` sets only `SWC_NODE_PROJECT`, and `globalSetup` spawns
 * this script with whatever environment it inherited — while `DATABASE_URL`,
 * the variable that actually decides which database is emptied, was never
 * looked at. The final review found it as I-2. The guard now reads the
 * connection string; see
 * `doc/decision/0276-destructive-database-scripts-are-guarded-by-the-connection-string.md`.
 *
 * That guard is also what makes the un-restored reservation window below
 * defensible rather than merely acknowledged: the only databases this script
 * can reach without an explicit `GARAGE_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_RESET=1` are ones
 * whose settings nobody is entitled to rely on between runs.
 *
 * ## `SWC_NODE_PROJECT`
 *
 * Both callers set `SWC_NODE_PROJECT=tsconfig.base.json`. This file imports
 * `@garage/shared-types` by its workspace alias rather than re-deriving the
 * month arithmetic, `@swc-node/register` resolves `paths` from the tsconfig it
 * is pointed at, and there is no `tsconfig.json` at the workspace root — so
 * without that variable the process dies with `Cannot find module
 * '@garage/shared-types'`. `seed.ts` needs no such thing because it imports
 * only relative paths.
